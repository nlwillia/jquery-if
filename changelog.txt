____________________________
Version 1.0.2 (2011-03-11)
	
	Now using .pushStack() internally for both true and false outcomes, and the .pushStack() call now supports passing 'name' and 'arguments' as the second and third arguments to .pushStack().  These two additional arguments were added to .pushStack() in jQuery 1.3.  The IF plugin is still compatible with jQuery 1.2+, the limiting factor being that $.isFunction() was added to jQuery in version 1.2.
